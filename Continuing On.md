**Past Week**

I have been inactive on Github for the past week or so, as it was the last few days of preperation for Security+. Now that I have passed the exam, I plan to take a week or two off from studying which then I get back to studying for the next exam. 
Over the past three months or so I have made a commitment to separating myself from other candidates in this field. Balancing this learning journey alongside my five ongoing classes has been challenging, but it's a challenge I've embraced.
I look forward to the next steps in my journey, which include applying my knowledge and skills to new opportunities in the field.

**What I Will Do Now**

I'll be working on creating a revised resume that not only adds my new certification but also undergoes an overhaul to better align with my career aspirations. Today specifically, I will be building a file integrity monitor (FIM) using 
PowerShell. This project will ensure the integrity and security of files by detecting any unauthorized changes or compromises. As I continue to expand my skill set, my next endeavor will be studying for the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) 
certification. While some opt for the Network+ certification, the networking courses during college and my career goals make CCNA a more suitable choice for me. I believe that building a strong foundation in networking is crucial for my future.

Recognizing the competitive nature of the job market, I'm committed to staying motivated and going above and beyond to stand out as a candidate. I aim to leverage my certifications, practical experience, and continuous learning to gain an edge.
Once my revised resume is ready, I plan to actively apply for job opportunities, alongside completing my current semester of school. I'm open to the possibility of taking a break from full-time classes and transitioning to part-time enrollment if the right job opportunity arises. 
This move will allow me to balance my education with real-world experience, setting me on a path towards my desired career goals.

Recognizing the importance of experience in the IT field, I'm fully committed to advancing my career growth. One of the ways I've been achieving this is by staying updated with the latest developments through podcasts and live streams on 
platforms like YouTube, particularly in cybersecurity. I've found that centering myself in these resources not only keeps me informed but is a constant source of inspiration and motivation. My interest in cybersecurity is constantly growing, and while 
I may not yet have a formal role in the field, these podcasts and streams have been key to help me grasp the day to day activites in the cybersecurity space. 


**In the Future**

As I said above my next certificate should hopefully be the CCNA which will provide a strong foundation in networking. Following that, I would like to take cloud security certs with AWS to create secure cloud environments and add on Splunk as well for log analysis and monitoring. 

Another personal project I would like to complete is a virtual enterprise environment. This environment will include components like a firewall (possibly OPNsense or a similar solution), an Active Directory server, a vulnerability scanner (Nessus but with plans to explore OpenVAS), a VPN server, and an SIEM (with a preference for Wazuh or Splunk). 
There would of course be other desktop VMs behind the firewall as well, Linux distro (probably Ubuntu) and Windows 10. This hands-on project will provide a practical understanding of network and security configurations.

I plan to also keep working with Powershell in projects, since I am not a programmer/coder by nature it helps to learn how actual scripts work rather than learning the syntax. Continuing to work with PowerShell on various projects has increased my 
understanding of the scripting process and where it can be applied. It's a valuable skill that can add to my technical abilities.

The most exciting goal I have, is to secure a position in the industry before the end of the year. After pursuing this IT for about 2 years, through school and personal learnings, the idea of starting this journey is surreal and motivating. Regardless of where I begin, gaining hands-on experience and diving into the 
inner workings of the field is truly something I desire. I'm confident that this path aligns with my long term goals, and I'm prepared to enjoy every moment of it.
