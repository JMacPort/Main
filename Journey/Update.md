I have a somewhat large update to bring to anyone who may come across this and is interested.

I've decided that instead of continuing on with my local community college, I will apply for the Cybersecurity program at WGU. *Note: I am finishing this semester and will be looking to start WGU in January or Febuary.* 
This will not only get me a bachelors, it will also give about 9 more certifications to add to my tool belt. While I have been applying to jobs with my current projects, I feel as though
many others will have much more to show for themselves in terms of certifications and degrees. I will try to document my process in an easy to follow format with what classes I have to take, what will transfer over and what I can look forward to in my first term there. Since I do have quite a bit of time on my hands, 
I am going to attempt to complete the degree in under a year but in no way will I rush this more than humanly possible. If I do not feel ready for an exam or certification test I will not take it. This should hopefully provide me with a clear path forward that has more prestige than what I am currently doing. Below I will include
the courses that are needed to pass the program along with the certifications that are taken throughout as well. To my knowledge, to pass a class there is a combination of things that may be presented such as a proctored exam, a presentation/paper or passing the certification exam. Currently I do not know if there is a combination of 
those or if it is dependant on the class but I am not worried. 

Later today I will call the enrollment office and see if they can answer my questions and possibly get me on a track so I know what to expect when I start. I've read the advisors are very helpful and friendly so I am looking forward to a positive experience. Hopefully my basic credits can transfer over like my Gen Eds and Maths but I 
am unsure what happens with my Security+ since I would imagine I would not be taking this certification again, so maybe there is a test I can do that will simply pass the class or just get credit for the class since I have it. Anyways, this is a large step for me and not really sure where the journey will end up but things are looking
pretty positive with this move and I will update when I know more about transfers/aid/etc. :wave: :wave:
