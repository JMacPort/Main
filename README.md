This account will serve as a directory for the home labs and projects I create while in school (and maybe future). Currently, I am in my second semester at a local community college in their IT: Cybersecurity program, so a little over halfway to an Associates Degree. 
Along with going to school, I simultaneously studied for the Security+ exam which I have just completed on October 4th. While I do not have a formal IT background, I have worked with computers since I was 10 or so and have had a strong passion since. Soon, I plan to build 
my first PC as in the past years I have either just upgraded the CPU/GPU or installed more RAM so I think building a PC will be much more fulfilling. Come time, I would like to have more projects here and also create a small blog site for tutorials and security write ups. 

Midway of the covid restrictions, I lost my job due to layoffs which led me to start researching career paths. With the knowledge I gained doing that, I discovered many different tech jobs and researched various jobs within the field. I was immediately drawn in to the 
security side of IT and started to figure out what I would need to learn to gain a role in this field. There seemed to be a general consensus that one would need to have a few years of experience in entry level IT, gain some certifications and then it may be possible to transition in. 
Since around June of 2022 I pivoted from just playing around with different linux distributions to learning more about digital security. Researching attack vectors, policies and regulations, cloud computing, previous large data breaches and more. 
All of this led me to decide to go back to school at 22 years old. I found a local community college that offered the program and have been there for just over a year. 

**So far school has taught me**:
- Secure Cisco Router/Switch setup
- Using Packet Tracer to build network topologies
- Basic network cabling
- Basics of Python 
- Hardware virtualization/VMs
- Attack vectors
- Secure data practices
- Encryption/Decryption/Hashing algorithms

**Certifications**:
- Security+ Expires October 4, 2026
- Google IT Support (From school)

**Skills**:
- Active Directory
- Frameworks - Cyber Kill Chain, Mitre ATT&CK, Diamond Model
- Azure Suite - Sentinel, Log Analytic Workspaces, Microsoft Defender, Entra ID, Virtual Machines, Resource Groups, etc.
- Vulnerability Management Software - Nessus, (OpenVAS soon)
- Basic Powershell
  
**Goals I have for this year**:
- Gain at least an entry level help desk role, perferrably an SOC T1 Analyst
- Get at minimum my Security+ certification, ideally Network+ and A+ as well.
- Graduate with an Associates
- Deeper unstanding of Python for automation
- Start configuring a home lab with VMs
- Continue self learning 

**In 4-5 years I would like to**:
- Have CISSP and CySA+ certifications
- Hopefully be working in a Cybersecurity Analyst position (or higher)
- Build out more home labs and practice via CTFs
- Nail down the career direction I would like to take. 

It took me awhile to figure out what route I wanted to take in life, but in the back of my head it always had to do with technology. With further research into cybersecurity, this proves to be exactly what I had in mind. The field is constantly changing,
evolving and growing on a daily basis. This is something that was a strong desire in choosing a career path and the reason it took me so long to decide. But, now that I have it figured out I am very determined to make it happen.

Thank you for reading and taking the time to get to know me.
