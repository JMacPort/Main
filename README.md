This account will serve as a directory for the home labs and projects I create while in school (and maybe future). Currently, I am in my second semester at a local community college in their IT: Cybersecurity program, so a little over halfway to an Associates Degree. 
Within the next month I will be taking my Security+ exam and I have been studying day in and out, along with taking many practice exams. I will update this when my certification has been completed. 
While I do not have a formal IT background, I have worked with computers since I was 10 or so and have had a strong passion since. Soon, I plan to build my first PC as in the past years I have either just upgraded the CPU/GPU or installed more RAM so I think building
a PC will be much more fulfilling. 
Come time, I would like to have more projects here and also create a small blog site for tutorials and security write ups. 

The past few years, since the beginning of the covid restrictions, I traded and researched a lot of crypto. Through the knowledge I gained doing that, I noticed the massive importance on security while still providing a functional experience. This led me to
researching features that Solidity has and what security measures are put in place. While I can't write much Solidty, but I taught myself how to research the functions included in the smart contracts. These range from selling taxes to distribution methods.
Since around June of 2022 I pivoted to learning more about digital security. Researching attack vectors, policies and regulations, cloud computing, previous large data breaches and more. 
All of this led me to decide to go back to school at 22 years old. I found a local community college that offered the program and have been there for just over a year. 

So far school has taught me:
- Secure Cisco Router/Switch setup
- Using Packet Tracer to build network topologies
- Basic network cabling
- Basics of Python 
- Hardware virtualization/VMs
- Attack vectors
- Secure data practices
- Encryption/Decryption/Hashing algorithms

While in school I also have done a lot of self learning mostly on tryhackme. This taught me a lot of concepts regarding cybersecurity and even other operating systems like Unix based OS. It also taught me the various jobs and roles that different 
positions may entail. Currently in tryhackme I am working through the SOC Tier 1 path.

The paths I already have started or completed are: 
- Introduction to Cybersecurity (Completed)
- Pre Security (Completed)
- SOC Tier 1 (1/3 done)
- Cyber Defense (Halfway Completed)
  
Goals I have for this year:
- Get an entry level help desk role
- Get at minimum my Security+ certification, ideally Network+ and A+ as well.
- Graduate with an Associates
- Deeper unstanding of Python for automation
- Start configuring a home lab with VMs
- Continue self learning 

In 4-5 years I would like to:
- Have CISSP and CISA certifications
- Hopefully be working in a Cybersecurity Analyst position (or higher)
- Build out more home labs and practice via CTFs
- Nail down the career direction I would like to take. 

It took me awhile to figure out what route I wanted to take in life, but in the back of my head it always had to do with technology. With further research into cybersecurity, this proves to be exactly what I had in mind. The field is constantly changing,
evolving and growing on a daily basis. This is something that was a strong desire in choosing a career path and the reason it took me so long to decide. But, now that I have it figured out I am very determined to make it happen.

Thank you for reading and taking the time to get to know me.
